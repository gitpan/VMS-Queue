Revision history for Perl extension VMS::Queue

0.01  Mon Dec 01 13:32:04 1997
	- Copied over from VMS::Process.
    - Implemented the xxx_list, xxx_info, and xxx_properties routines.
      xxx_list doesn't take a property hash yet, though.

0.02  Wed Dec 10 09:22:05 1997
    - Fixed basic.t. (Was VMS::Process' tests--chopped out everything but
      test 1)
    - Added xxx_bitmap_decode functions.
    - Took quicktest.pl out of MANIFEST. MakeMaker'll whine on a distclean,
      but at least quicktest.pl won't get installed now.

0.03  Mon Dec 15 12:34:12 1997
    - Added delete_entry, delete_queue, delete_form, delete_manager, and
      delete_characteristic functions
    - modified the xxx_properties function. The value for each key is now a
      hash, with four keys, INPUT_INFO, OUTPUT_INFO, INPUT_ACTION, and
      OUTPUT_ACTION. The values for these keys will be true or false,
      depending on whether the property is an input or output property for
      the action or info functions. A property can be multiple things.
    - Added stop_queue, start_queue, reset_queue, and pause_queue
      functions.
    - Added start_manager and stop_manager functions.
    - Added hold_entry and release_entry functions.

0.05  Mon Dec 23 15:25:03 1997
    - Added docs for the file_list, file_properties, and file_bitmap_decode
      functions.
    - Added in code for the file_properties and file_bitmap_decode functions.

0.06  Wed Dec 31 15:54:34 1997
    - Added all the functions to the EXPORT_OK list.

0.07  Wed Jan 07 09:47:06 1998
    - Made a change to generic_getqui_call to take two additional parameters--
      the number of 'reserved' slots at the beginning of the item list, and
      a second 'okay' JBC status. (Added for file_info, which needs to work
      in wildcard mode)
    - Added return JBC status and context parameter to gneric_getqui_call.
      Amazingly, it all still works.
    - Added the file_list function
    - Fixed generic_getqui_call--it leaked memory like a sieve.
    - generic_getqui_call's array indexing was totally whacked. It never
      showed up before because everything always called it with an offset
      of one, which just happened to work.

0.08  Wed Jan 28 15:40:04 1998
    - Added code for the submit function, and at least some of the SNDJBC
      item codes. As of 2/12/98, it works.

0.09  Fri Feb 13 11:56:03 1998
    - Created the build_itemlist and tear_down_itemlist functions to create
      or destroy itemlists.
    - Added in a whole boatload of item codes for SNDJBC, as well as code
      to handle time and longword items to build_itemlist

0.10  Fri Feb 27 11:21:04 1998
    - Added more item codes for SNDJBC
    - Added in code for all the create_xxx and modify_xxx functions.
      They're all the same code with minor differences, so they've been
      rolled into one ALIAS:ed XSUB. Cool.
