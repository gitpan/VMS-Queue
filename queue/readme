This module lets you fetch information on, create, and manipulate, queues,
entries, queue managers, forms, and characteristics. If you can manipulate
something queue-ish in DCL, or fetch the information in DCL via F$GETQUI,
odds are you can do it at least as well (if not better) with VMS::Queue.

perl Makefile.pl
mms
mms test
